        "\n",
        "Key to the performance of any machine learning algorithm is the successful extraction of salient features, which can come from both domain knowledge and computational feature extraction techniques<sup>1</sup>. Therefore the start of any machine learning project is to identify relevant features from knowledge of the data, in this case time-series, or the previous literature on that domain. \n",
        "\n",
        "For my own research I extracted a number of features specific to the type of epilpesy I worked on. This tutorial will go over a few of the features that were the easiest to extract. We are going to start this series of tutorials with a small dataset, used by a number of authors, as this will help us get up and running very quickly. Below is a good description of the data by one of the papers who has previously used this dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *\"Five sets (denoted  A–E) each containing  100  single-channel EEG segments of 23.6-sec duration, were composed for the study. These segments were selected and cut out from continuous multichannel EEG recordings after visual inspection  for  artifacts,  e.g.,  due  to  muscle  activity  or  eye  movements. In addition, the segments had to fulfill a stationarity criterion described in detail in Sec. II B. Sets A and B consisted  of  segments  taken  from  surface  EEG  recordings  that were carried out on five healthy volunteers using a standardized  electrode  placement  scheme. Volunteers were relaxed in an awake state with eyes open (A) and eyes closed (B) respectively. Sets C, D, and E originated from our EEG archive of presurgical diagnosis. For the present study EEGs  from  five  patients  were  selected,  all  of  whom  had achieved  complete  seizure  control  after  resection  of  one  of the  hippocampal  formations,  which  was  therefore  correctly diagnosed to be the epileptogenic zone. Segments in set D were recorded from within the epileptogenic zone, and  those  in  set  C  from  the  hippocampal  formation  of  the opposite hemisphere of the brain. While sets C and D contained  only  activity  measured  during  seizure  free  intervals, set  E  only  contained  seizure  activity.  Here  segments  were selected from all recording sites exhibiting ictal activity. All   EEG   signals   were   recorded   with   the   same   128-channel  amplifier  system,  using  an  average  common  reference [omitting electrodes containing pathological activity (C, D, and E) or strong eye movement artifacts (A and B)]. After 12  bit  analog-to-digital  conversion,  the  data  were  written continuously  onto  the  disk  of  a  data  acquisition  computer system  at  a  sampling  rate  of  173.61  Hz.  Band-pass  filter settings were 0.53– 40 Hz (12 dB/oct.).\"*<sup>2</sup> \n",

        "First lets look at how we compute a periodogram using the Welch method.\n",
        "\n",
        "As EEG contains events that occur at different overlapping frequencies, subspectral components of an EEG signal are often separated and processed discretely, allowing for the decomposition of the signal into frequency bands. To describe a signal in terms of its the frequency components, the data can be transformed by projecting it onto sinusoidal basis functions; with this transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain known as a Fourier transform<sup>1</sup>. Fourier transforms measure oscillation amplitude independent of phase, meaning latency variation can be avoided<sup>2</sup>. Indeed, short-time Fourier transformation’s (STFT), which windows the EEG signal and applies a fast Fourier transformation to each data frame<sup>3</sup>, are often applied to EEG data. Although broadly used, Fourier transforms can loose temporal information from data due to stretching the signal to fit onto sine waves<sup>4</sup>, and the same window size is used to calculate power in different frequencies despite low and high frequencies yielding greater precision with different window sizes<sup>2</sup>. Indeed, the width of the ‘window’ used on the data is important as it can result in poor frequency resolution if too narrow, or poor time localisation that violates the stationarity assumption if too wide<sup>1,5</sup>.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Welch method is related to a Short-time Fourier transform in that it is a spectral density estimation method that calculates a periodogram for windowed sections of data. Overlapping segments are windowed, as this helps mitagate the loss of information at the edges of the time window, with a discrete Fourier tranform applied to calculate the periodogram. Data is squared and each periodogram averaged to reduce the variance of each power measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Welch method is a common and easy method to apply in both Matlab and Python. In python we can use scipy to get out the power spectral density.\n",
        "\n",
        "__NOTES__\n",
        "- The code I wrote will not work with frequencies below 1hz IF we are using 2 second windows because you want at least 2 cycles so for 0.5 you'd need 4 seconds.\n",

        "\n",
        "The log sum of the wavelet coefficients is a common method<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> in the seizure detection literature to create a feature for the machine learning method. The detail coefficents without futher processing can eb sensitive to noise, therefore Shoeb et. al. suggested applying the log-sum energy of the subband coefficients as features. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The log transform is a power transform which change the distribution of a variable so that the variance is no longer dependent on the mean. The log function maps a range of numbers to a smaller range by compressing large numbers and expanding the range of small numbers. For example log10(x) maps the range of [1, 10] to [0, 1], [10, 100] to [1, 2]. The log is particularly useful where there is a heavy-tailed distribution because it compresses the long tail at the high end of the distribution and extends the low tail<sup>5</sup>. \n",
